- We use the <b>ffn</b> (financial functions for python) python package for our analysis. It  provides a huge set of useful information 
regarding stock performance in a very simple and straight-forward way. Combining it with matplotlib, we can intuitively detect stock 
trends or patterns, as well as technically interpret statistical insights to tell a enlightening story.  
- pip install ffn  
- %pylab inline is a 'magic function in iPython used to control the default size of figures in the notebook.  
- By default ffn-get function uses <i>Yahoo Finance</i> to gather the historical data.  
- Analysis on GAFA - Google,Apple,Facebook,Amazon.  
- The <b><i>.rebase()</i></b> function allows us to plot the time series from a common starting point, to see how each stock performed 
relative to another.
