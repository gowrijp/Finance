## Duration and Convexity to Measure Bond Risk
- Duration and convexity are two tools used to manage the risk exposure of fixed-income investments.
-  Duration measures the bond's sensitivity to interest rate changes.
-  Convexity relates to the interaction between a bond's price and its yield as it experiences changes in interest rates.
